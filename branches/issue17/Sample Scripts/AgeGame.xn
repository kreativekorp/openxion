If you   --haven't, add 1747.  --6 Last step: Subtract the four digit year that you were born.  --RESULTS:  --You should now have a three digit number:  --The first digit of this was your original number (i.e. how many times you   --want to go out each week).  --The second two digits are your age!!! It really works.  --This is the only year (1998) it will ever work, so spread the joy around by   --mailing this to everyone you know.
