-- Testing functionality of Merge
put Merge((1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8))
put Merge((2,4,6,8),(1,3,5,7))
put Merge((0,3,6,9),(2,4,8,16))
put Merge((10,12,14,16),(3,5,7,9))
put Merge((5,6,10,11),(2,3,8,9))

-- Testing base cases of MergeSort
put MergeSort(empty)
put MergeSort(3)
put MergeSort(4.12)
put MergeSort(-7)
put MergeSort(0)

-- Testing MergeSort itself
local x as list is (5, 9, 3.14, 12, 0, -4, 18, -7.7, 1, 36, 2.4, 42.01, -99)
put MergeSort(x)
sort elements of x numeric
put x

-- Testing technical aspects of argument passing
put MergeSort()
put MergeSort(empty)
put MergeSort(0)
put MergeSort(1)
put MergeSort(2,7,5)
put MergeSort((2,7,5) as list)
