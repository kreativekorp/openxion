= Using the Downloaded Files =

You can use OpenXION without any complex installation procedure. Just execute the jar from the command line:

{{{
java -jar OpenXION.jar
}}}

To get a list of command line options, execute:

{{{
java -jar OpenXION.jar --help
}}}

However, if you'd like to make more of a permanent home for OpenXION on your system, follow the following complex installation procedure.

= Installation from Downloaded Files =

The only files you'll need to download to make a complete OpenXION environment are *OpenXION-1.1.jar* and *XIONDoc-1.1.jar*. Download these to a known location. Then use these commands to move them to their final destinations:

{{{
sudo mv OpenXION-1.1.jar /usr/lib/OpenXION.jar
sudo mv XIONDoc-1.1.jar /usr/lib/XIONDoc.jar
}}}

Now, create /usr/bin/xion

{{{
#!/bin/sh
java -Xmx1024M -jar /usr/lib/OpenXION.jar "$@"
}}}

and make it executable.

Create /usr/bin/xe

{{{
#!/bin/sh
java -Xmx1024M -jar /usr/lib/OpenXION.jar -e "$*"
}}}

and make it executable.

Create /usr/bin/xiondoc

{{{
#!/bin/sh
java -Xmx1024M -jar /usr/lib/XIONDoc.jar "$@"
}}}

and make it executable.

= Installation from Source =

Use this command to check out the latest project source:

{{{
svn checkout http://openxion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/main/java/OpenXION/ openxion
}}}

Change to the directory you just checked out:

{{{
cd openxion
}}}

Build and install with make:

{{{
make
sudo make install
}}}

Enter your administrator password when prompted.
