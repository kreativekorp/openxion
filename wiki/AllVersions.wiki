#summary List of all versions of OpenXION

= OpenXION 0.9 =

Source code and compiled binaries of version 0.9 of OpenXION are available at the Robert E. Kennedy Library at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The call number is 09-0385. There is no reason you would want this except as a historical curiosity.

= Release Versions =

Each release of OpenXION also includes XIONDoc, the documentation generator tool. The version number of XIONDoc changes only when XIONDoc has actually changed, so multiple OpenXION releases may include the same version of XIONDoc.
