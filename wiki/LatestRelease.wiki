#summary Information about the latest release version of OpenXION.

= OpenXION 1.3 is out! =

OpenXION 1.3 is the latest release version of OpenXION, the reference implementation of XION, the open scripting language based on !HyperTalk. Version 1.3 introduces several new features and fixes major issues with lists and containers.

= Repeat Lastly =

Use the `lastly` construction in repeat blocks to execute code when the loop terminates normally.

{{{
-- the following prints "done" because the loop terminates normally
repeat with x = 1 to 10
  put x
lastly
  put "done"
end repeat
}}}

{{{
-- the following does not print "done" because the loop terminates abnormally
repeat with x = 1 to 10
  put x
  if x is 5 then exit repeat
lastly
  put "done"
end repeat
}}}

= Dictionaries =

Use dictionaries to map strings to values. Use braces to indicate dictionary literals. Use the `entry` chunk type to manipulate dictionaries.

{{{
local d as dictionary
put {
  "a" = "apple"
  "b" = "raise"
} into d
put entry "a" of d
put "kreative" into entry "c" of d
put d
}}}

= References =

Use references to pass containers around without using string literals or the value function.

= ASCII-to-Binary and Binary-to-ASCII =

Use the `atob` and `btoa` functions to encode and decode data in Base64, ASCII85, and other encodings.

= Translate Characters =

Use the `trReplace` and `trReplaceAll` functions to perform `tr` substitutions.
